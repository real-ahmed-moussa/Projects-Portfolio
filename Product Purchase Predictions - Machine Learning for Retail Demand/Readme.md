# 📌 Product Purchase Predictions: Machine Learning for Retail Demand
> A sequence-modeling pipeline that forecasts **per-product daily purchases** using a **CNN+LSTM** architecture over lagged and calendar features—built with PyTorch for scalable, multi-output regression.


## 📖 Overview
- This project implements a **time-series forecasting** pipeline to predict **next-day demand** for multiple products simultaneously (multi-output regression).
- The workflow builds **lag features** for each product and adds **calendar features**(month, day-of-week, weekend flag), then converts the data into fixed-length sequences (e.g., `seq_len = 3`) for temporal learning.
- A **CNN+LSTM** network first applies **1D convolutions across feature channels** to learn local patterns, then an **LSTM** captures temporal dependencies, and a final dense layer outputs predictions for **all products at once**.
- The model is trained with **MSE loss** and **Adam** optimizer; performance is evaluated with **MAE/MSE** (including per-product MAE).


## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Multi-Output Forecasting:** Predicts next-day demand for N products in one forward pass.
- ✅ **Temporal Feature Engineering:** Automatic **lagged features + calendar features** (month, day-of-week, weekend).
- ✅ **Sequence Windowing:** Converts tabular time series into (`batch, seq_len, features`) tensors.
- ✅ CNN+LSTM Architecture: Convolutional blocks for local patterns → LSTM for temporal dynamics.
- ✅ **GPU-Ready Training:** Seamless CPU/GPU execution with PyTorch `.to(device)`.
- ✅ **Clear Evaluation:** Training vs. testing loss curves.


## 🏢 Business Impact
> *Enable smarter **inventory planning, procurement, and targeted promotions** by anticipating product-level demand. Multi-output forecasts reduce operational risk, improve stock availability, and support staffing decisions—store by store, day by day.*
