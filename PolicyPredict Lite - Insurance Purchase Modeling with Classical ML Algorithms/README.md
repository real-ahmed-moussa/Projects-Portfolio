# 📌 PolicyPredict Lite: Insurance Purchase Modeling with Classical ML Algorithms
> Lightweight machine learning solution leveraging classical models to predict customer purchase behavior for insurance policies, providing fast and interpretable insights to support marketing and sales strategies.


## 📖 Overview
- This project implements a **scikit-learn-based machine learning pipeline** to predict whether customers are likely to purchase additional insurance products.
- The solution emphasizes **simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency**, avoiding the computational overhead of deep learning models.
- It integrates **data preprocessing, feature selection, multiple model training, and performance evaluation**, enabling rapid experimentation and actionable business insights.


## 🏢 Business Impact
PolicyPredict Lite empowers insurers with a **fast, interpretable, and cost-efficient predictive modeling framework**, allowing them to **prioritize leads, optimize cross-selling strategies, and improve customer outreach** without needing deep learning infrastructure.


## 🚀 Features
✅ **Multiple Model Evaluation:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM compared within the same pipeline.  
✅ **End-to-End ML Workflow:** From raw dataset to processed features, trained models, and evaluated performance metrics.  
✅ **Interpretable Insights:** Feature importance and coefficients allow business teams to understand key drivers of customer purchases.  
✅ **Lightweight Deployment:** No specialized infrastructure required; can be run on any machine with Python installed.
