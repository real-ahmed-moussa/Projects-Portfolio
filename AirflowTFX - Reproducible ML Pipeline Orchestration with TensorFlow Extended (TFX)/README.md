# 📌 AirflowTFX: Reproducible ML Pipeline Orchestration with TensorFlow Extended (TFX)
> End-to-end machine learning pipeline built with TFX and orchestrated via Apache Airflow, demonstrating automated, reproducible ML workflows using a real-world dataset.


## 📖 Overview
 - This project implements a **TFX-based ML pipeline** for **medical insurance cost prediction**, orchestrated with Apache Airflow to enable automated and repeatable workflows.
- Unlike the original reference implementation from "Building Machine Learning Pipelines" (Hapke & Nelson, 2020), this version uses a **custom dataset** and tailored preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation steps to showcase applied MLOps skills.
 - The pipeline was developed in a **local Airflow environment** (non-containerized), focusing on **pipeline modularity and automation**.
 - Due to compatibility issues between Airflow and TFX installations, the TFX pipeline was created separately. A dedicated virtual environment was then invoked from within Airflow to execute the compiled pipeline file, as defined in the `TFX_Pipeline_DAG.py` script.


## 🏢 Business Impact
This project demonstrates how **structured, automated pipelines** can streamline model development, reduce manual intervention, and increase **traceability and reproducibility**—critical steps toward production-ready ML infrastructure in real-world scenarios.


## 🚀 Features
✅ **End-to-End Workflow:** Covers data ingestion, schema validation, transformation, training, and evaluation in one orchestrated pipeline.  
✅ **Custom Dataset Integration:** Adapted pipeline components for real-world medical cost data.  
✅ **Airflow Orchestration:** DAG-based execution, logging, and task dependency management for reproducible runs.  
✅ **TFX Ecosystem:** Leveraged TFDV, TFT, and TFMA for scalable, standardized ML operations.
