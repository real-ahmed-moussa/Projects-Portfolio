### 🏗️ **Pipeline Workflow**
1. **Model Training & Versioning:**
   - Train a **Logistic Regression Model** on telecom data.
   - Save models with versioned names (`churn_pred_model_v1.pkl`).
   - **Track model metrics and parameters with MLflow.**

2. **API Deployment:**
   - Serve predictions via `app.py` using **FastAPI**.
   - API listens on `http://localhost:8000/predict`.

3. **Drift Detection & Monitoring:**
   - **EvidentlyAI** compares incoming data with reference data.
   - Drift detection triggers retraining when performance drops.
   - Retrained models are versioned and tracked via MLflow.

4. **CI/CD with GitHub Actions:**
   - Automate Docker builds and model versioning.
   - Push images to Docker Hub.
   - Deploy updated services when drift is detected.
