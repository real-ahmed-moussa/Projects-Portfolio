# 📌 DeepVision: Video Analysis
> A deep learning solution for automated video content analysis using a ConvLSTM-based classification model.


## 📖 Overview
 - This project implements a **ConvLSTM-based video classification model** to analyze sequential video frames and predict target labels.
 - The architecture combines **convolutional layers** for spatial feature extraction and LSTM units to capture temporal patterns across frames.
 - The solution was developed and evaluated in a **Jupyter Notebook environment**, showcasing a complete ML pipeline from preprocessing to model training and testing *(Note: This version does not include containerization or production deployment)*.


## 🚀 Features
   - ✅ **ConvLSTM Architecture:** Combines CNN and LSTM layers for superior video sequence modeling.
   - ✅ **Automated Frame Processing:** OpenCV pipeline for frame extraction, resizing, and normalization.
   - ✅ **End-to-End ML Workflow:** Covers data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and predictions for unseen video data.
   - ✅ **Reproducible Notebook Implementation:** Allows step-by-step review and experimentation.


## 🏢 Business Impact
   > *Demonstrates the potential of AI-powered video analysis to **automate complex video review processes**, enabling applications such as **real-time quality inspection, security anomaly detection, and automated video tagging**, reducing manual review time and increasing insight accuracy.*
