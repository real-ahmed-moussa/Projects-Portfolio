# 📌 ChurnFlow: End-to-End MLOps Pipeline for Customer Retention
> A production-ready MLOps solution designed to predict and mitigate customer churn using a fully automated pipeline.


## 📖 Overview
- **ChurnFlow** implements a complete machine learning lifecycle for customer churn prediction in a telecom business context.
- The project demonstrates expertise in **MLOps, automation, and real-time model serving**, integrating continuous monitoring and retraining for long-term reliability.
- The pipeline was **containerized using Docker** and automated with **GitHub Actions**, ensuring seamless deployment and scalability.


## 🏢 Business Impact
This pipeline significantly reduced the time-to-deployment and maintenance overhead for predictive models, enabling proactive customer retention strategies. Telecom teams could identify at-risk customers early, reducing churn rates and improving overall customer lifetime value.


## 🚀 Features
✅ **Real-Time Model Serving:** FastAPI-based REST API for on-demand churn predictions.  
✅ **CI/CD Automation:** GitHub Actions for automatic builds, testing, and deployment.  
✅ **Drift Detection & Retraining:** EvidentlyAI triggers model retraining when data or prediction drift is detected.  
✅ **Experiment Tracking:** MLflow for model performance logging and version control.

## 🛠️ Installation
1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/ahmedmoussa/Projects-Portfolio.git
cd churnflow-mlops-pipeline
</pre>

2️⃣ **Create Virtual Environment**
<pre>
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
</pre>

3️⃣ **Install Dependencies**
<pre>
pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre>


▶️ **Usage**

1️⃣ **Train and Save Model**

Run the training script to train and version your model:
<pre>
python src/train_model.py
</pre>
This will:
 - Train a Logistic Regression model on the churn dataset.
 - Save the model to the `models/` folder.
 - Log parameters, metrics, and artifacts in MLflow (`mlruns/` directory).

2️⃣ **Start API Server**

Use Docker to build and run the API container:
<pre>
docker build -t churnflow-api -f Dockerfile.api .
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 churnflow-api
</pre>
The API will be available at:
<pre>
http://localhost:8000/predict
</pre>

3️⃣ **Make Predictions**
<pre>
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "tenure": 12,
    "MonthlyCharges": 29.99,
    "TotalCharges": 349.88,
    "gender": 0,
    "Partner": 1,
    "Dependents": 0,
    "PhoneService": 1,
    "MultipleLines": 1,
    "InternetService": 0,
    "OnlineSecurity": 1,
    "OnlineBackup": 0,

    "PaymentMethod": 3
}' http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict
</pre>

4️⃣ **Monitor Drift**
<pre>
docker build -t churnflow-monitor -f Dockerfile.monitor .
docker run -d -p 8050:8050 churnflow-monitor
</pre>
 - EvidentlyAI Dashboard: http://localhost:8050
 - Detects data drift and performance degradation, triggering retraining when necessary.


## 📊 Results
   - **Baseline Logistic Regression Model Accuracy:** 80%
   - **Baseline Logistic Regression Model AUC:** 84%
   - **EvidentlyAI reports:** Drift visualization available in `report.html`.
