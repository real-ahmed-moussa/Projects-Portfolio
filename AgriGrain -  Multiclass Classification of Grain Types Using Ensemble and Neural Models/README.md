# 🌾 AgriGrain: Multiclass Classification of Grain Types Using Ensemble and Neural Models
> ML-based solution to classify various grain types based on geometric features, enabling automation in agricultural quality control and grain sorting processes.


## 📖 Overview
This project implements a **multiclass classification pipeline** to distinguish between different grain types using geometric and shape-based features.
The solution was built entirely in **R**, leveraging **ensemble algorithms** and **artificial neural networks** for improved predictive accuracy.


## 🚀 Features
✅ **Multiple Algorithms:** Bagging, Random Forests, Boosting, Mixture Discriminant Analysis, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).  
✅ **Automated Grain Classification:** Helps reduce manual effort in grain type identification.  
✅ **Multiclass Support:** Predicts multiple categories instead of binary classification.  
✅ **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Includes accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.


## 🏢 Business Impact
   > This solution enhanced the **accuracy and efficiency** of grain classification, reducing reliance on manual inspection and supporting scalable agricultural technology applications*
