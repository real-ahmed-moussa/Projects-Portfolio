# 📌 Association Rule Mining: Market Basket Insights
> A retail analytics project applying association rule mining to uncover hidden product co-purchasing patterns, enabling smarter cross-selling, bundling, and promotion strategies.


## 📖 Overview
- This project applies **unsupervised learning** techniques to discover relationships between products purchased together.
- By leveraging **Apriori** and **association rule mining**, it generates interpretable rules (support, confidence, lift) that provide insights into **customer buying behavior**.  


## 🏢 Business Impact
Association Rule Mining empowers retailers to **optimize product placement, bundling, and promotions** by identifying hidden customer purchasing patterns. This leads to increased sales, higher customer satisfaction, and more effective marketing strategies.


## 🚀 Features
✅ **Market Basket Analysis**: Extracts frequent itemsets and co-occurrence patterns.  
✅ **Rule Mining**: Generates rules with support, confidence, and lift metrics.  
✅ **Actionable Insights**: Identifies product bundles for cross-selling.  
✅ **Reproducible Notebook**: End-to-end workflow in a single Jupyter notebook.
