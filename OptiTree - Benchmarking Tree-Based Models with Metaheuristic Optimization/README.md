# 📌 OptiTree: Benchmarking Tree-Based Models with Metaheuristic Optimization
> A high-performance framework for benchmarking and optimizing tree-based machine learning models using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), enabling efficient hyperparameter tuning and experiment tracking for structured classification tasks.


## 📖 Overview
- This project implements a **model benchmarking and optimization suite** for tree-based classifiers, comparing the performance of multiple algorithms under automated hyperparameter search.
- Instead of traditional grid or random search, this pipeline leverages **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** via the custom hyperparameter-optimizer library for **faster convergence and improved model accuracy**.
- Experiment tracking is handled by **MLflow**, while trained models are persisted with **joblib** for reproducibility.


## 🏢 Business Impact
OptiTree provides organizations with a **scalable, automated framework for selecting and tuning tree-based models**, resulting in **higher predictive accuracy, reduced manual effort, and faster iteration cycles** for decision-critical applications such as finance, healthcare, and risk management.


## 🚀 Features
✅ **Multi-Model Benchmarking:** Supports Decision Trees, Random Forests, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost classifiers.  
✅ **Automated Hyperparameter Optimization:** Uses PSO for efficient search across complex hyperparameter spaces.  
✅ **Experiment Tracking:** Logs performance metrics, parameters, and artifacts with MLflow.  
✅ **Model Serialization:** Stores best-performing models for later use and deployment.  
✅ **Reproducible Experiments:** Ensures consistent benchmarking and fair comparison across runs.
